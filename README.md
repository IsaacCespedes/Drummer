# Drummer
An old project, started with a codebase from a college assignment.

The idea was to build an application in which the user can compose a drum solo and to have a 3D model play back the solo.

"A Drumming simulation for Windows 32-bit. 
Click the boxes from left to right and the drummer will play the notes. 
Reclick a box to delete the note. The notes from the top row going downward are: crash, hihat, snare, hitom, midtom, lotom, bass. 
DirectX and Visual C++ redistributable are needed to run this..."
